# DT Frontend Assignment – DataFlow

This repo is my attempt at the DeepThought Frontend Intern assignment.

## What’s in here

- A single-page **DataFlow** landing screen with a header, hero, features and pricing, roughly following the shared Figma layout.
- **Task 1 – Webpage creation:** Built the page using plain HTML and CSS. I focused on getting the structure, spacing and basic responsive behaviour close to the design.
- **Task 2 – Dynamic elements:** Added a small JSON “data layer” in `script.js` and use it to render feature cards and pricing plans. The billing switch flips between monthly and yearly prices by re‑using the same JSON data.

## Stack I used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox + a few media queries)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM APIs, simple state for the billing toggle)

To try it locally, clone the repo and open `index.html` in a browser, or run it with any simple dev server (for example the Live Server extension in VS Code).
